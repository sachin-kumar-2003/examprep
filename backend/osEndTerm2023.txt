QUESTION NUMBER: 1
What is an operating system?
ANSWER: An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs.

---

QUESTION NUMBER: 2
What are the main functions of an operating system?
ANSWER:
- Process Management
- Memory Management
- File System Management
- Device Management
- Security and Access Control

---

QUESTION NUMBER: 3
Differentiate between system software and application software.
ANSWER: System software manages hardware and provides services to application software (e.g., OS). Application software performs user-specific tasks (e.g., MS Word).

---

QUESTION NUMBER: 4
What is kernel? What are its types?
ANSWER: The kernel is the core part of the OS that directly interacts with hardware. Types include:
- Monolithic Kernel
- Microkernel

---

QUESTION NUMBER: 5
Explain the concept of system calls in an operating system.
ANSWER: System calls are interfaces that allow user-level programs to request services from the kernel (e.g., read, write, execute).

---

QUESTION NUMBER: 6
What is the difference between multitasking and multiprocessing?
ANSWER:
- Multitasking: Multiple tasks share the same CPU sequentially.
- Multiprocessing: Multiple processors execute tasks simultaneously.

---

QUESTION NUMBER: 7
What is a process? How is it different from a program?
ANSWER: A process is an instance of a program in execution. A program is a passive entity, whereas a process is active.

---

QUESTION NUMBER: 8
Define thread. How is it different from a process?
ANSWER: A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process. Threads share process resources, while processes have their own resources.

---

QUESTION NUMBER: 9
What is a context switch?
ANSWER: It is the process of saving the state of one process and loading the state of another, allowing multitasking.

---

QUESTION NUMBER: 10
What is virtual memory, and why is it used?
ANSWER: Virtual memory is a memory management technique that uses disk storage as an extension of RAM. It enables larger programs to run and improves multitasking.

---

QUESTION NUMBER: 11
What are the different states of a process in an operating system?
ANSWER:
- New
- Ready
- Running
- Waiting
- Terminated

---

QUESTION NUMBER: 12
Explain the concept of process scheduling.
ANSWER: Process scheduling determines the order in which processes access the CPU based on scheduling algorithms.

---

QUESTION NUMBER: 13
What is a scheduling algorithm? Name a few types.
ANSWER: A scheduling algorithm determines the order of process execution. Types include:
- First Come First Serve (FCFS)
- Shortest Job Next (SJN)
- Round Robin (RR)
- Priority Scheduling

---

QUESTION NUMBER: 14
Differentiate between preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling.
ANSWER:
- Preemptive: A process can be interrupted.
- Non-preemptive: A process runs to completion without interruption.

---

QUESTION NUMBER: 15
What is round-robin scheduling, and how does it work?
ANSWER: Each process is assigned a fixed time slice (quantum) in round-robin scheduling. Processes are executed cyclically.

---

QUESTION NUMBER: 16
What are the differences between short-term, medium-term, and long-term schedulers?
ANSWER:
- Short-term: Select processes for CPU execution.
- Medium-term: Manages suspended processes.
- Long-term: Manages job admission.

---

QUESTION NUMBER: 17
What is the file system in an operating system?
ANSWER: The file system organizes and stores files on storage devices and manages file-related operations.

---

QUESTION NUMBER: 18
What are the different types of file systems?
ANSWER:
- FAT (File Allocation Table)
- NTFS (New Technology File System)
- ext (Extended File System)
- HFS (Hierarchical File System)

---

QUESTION NUMBER: 19
What is the difference between absolute and relative paths?
ANSWER:
- Absolute Path: Specifies the complete path from the root directory.
- Relative Path: Specifies the path relative to the current directory.

---

QUESTION NUMBER: 20
What is file allocation? Name a few techniques.
ANSWER: File allocation determines how files are stored on disk. Techniques include:
- Contiguous Allocation
- Linked Allocation
- Indexed Allocation

---

QUESTION NUMBER: 21
What is the inode in a file system?
ANSWER: An inode is a data structure storing metadata about a file, such as size, permissions, and disk locations.

---

QUESTION NUMBER: 22
What is disk scheduling?
ANSWER: Disk scheduling determines the order in which I/O requests are processed. Algorithms include FCFS, SSTF, and SCAN.

---

QUESTION NUMBER: 23
What is the difference between primary and secondary storage?
ANSWER:
- Primary Storage: Volatile memory (RAM).
- Secondary Storage: Non-volatile storage (HDD, SSD).

---

QUESTION NUMBER: 24
What is caching in operating systems?
ANSWER: Caching stores frequently accessed data in faster memory for quick retrieval.

---

QUESTION NUMBER: 25
What is the difference between a block and a sector in storage?
ANSWER:
- Sector: Smallest storage unit on a disk.
- Block: Group of sectors treated as a single unit by the file system.

---

QUESTION NUMBER: 26
What is spooling?
ANSWER: Spooling is a process where data is temporarily held to be used or executed later, commonly used in print queues.

---

QUESTION NUMBER: 27
What is the difference between a monolithic and a microkernel OS?
ANSWER:
- Monolithic Kernel: All OS services run in the kernel.
- Microkernel: Only essential services run in the kernel; others run in user space.

---

QUESTION NUMBER: 28
What is time-sharing in operating systems?
ANSWER: Time-sharing allows multiple users to use the system simultaneously by sharing CPU time.

---

QUESTION NUMBER: 29
What is an interrupt?
ANSWER: An interrupt signals the CPU to stop current tasks and execute a specific piece of code.

---

QUESTION NUMBER: 30
What is bootstrapping in operating systems?
ANSWER: Bootstrapping is the process of initializing the OS during the startup sequence.

---

QUESTION NUMBER: 31
What is the difference between firmware and an operating system?
ANSWER:
- Firmware: Low-level software embedded in hardware.
- OS: Higher-level software managing the entire system.

---

QUESTION NUMBER: 32
What is the difference between cooperative and preemptive multitasking?
ANSWER:
- Cooperative: Processes voluntarily yield control.
- Preemptive: OS forcibly takes control of processes.

---

QUESTION NUMBER: 33
What are the main types of operating systems?
ANSWER:
- Batch OS
- Time-Sharing OS
- Distributed OS
- Real-Time OS
- Embedded OS

---

QUESTION NUMBER: 34
What is an embedded operating system?
ANSWER: An OS designed for specialized devices with limited resources, such as IoT devices and appliances.

---

QUESTION NUMBER: 35
What is a hypervisor?
ANSWER: A hypervisor is software that allows multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine.
